# Room Booking Android App

This is an android app written mostly in Java. It utilizes the Master-Worker Protocol for task delegation and synchronization within the network. We integrated 
robust local network communication for seamless and real-time room availability updates. (The passcode for the manager is "admin")

## Here are some images from the app:
